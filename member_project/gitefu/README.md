I am a graduate school student majoring in processor research, and I am involved in robot building with a group called [tofunology](https://tofunology.github.io/site/).

One day, through an event, I learned about the organization [ISHI-KAI](https://ishi-kai.org/) and decided to participate in a project where each member creates an analog circuit to be integrated onto a single chip.

However, I had little knowledge of analog circuits. 
This was my first time making an operational amplifier, and being a beginner, I faced many challenges. However, with a lot of support from [ISHI-KAI](https://ishi-kai.org/)  members, I was able to complete it.

Through this project, I've gained a solid understanding of the fundamentals of analog circuits and the process of creating chips. I feel extremely pleased with the experience


## About My Circuit
This is the operational amplifier on a chip I made for the first time.This operational amplifier was created with reference to following website.
